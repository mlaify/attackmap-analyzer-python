# Changelog

All notable changes to `attackmap-analyzer-python` will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- Walk and read the repo with the shared `attackmap.sdk.fs` helpers
  (`iter_repo_files`, `read_source`, `rel`, `line_of`) instead of a private
  `rglob` + `SKIP_DIRS` walk ([mlaify/AttackMap#253](https://github.com/mlaify/AttackMap/issues/253)).
  Skip dirs are now `DEFAULT_SKIP_DIRS` plus `env`, `.ruff_cache` and `site-packages`.
- `priority` 15 → 10, so the plugin genuinely runs before the built-in
  `python-web` analyzer (20) now that core orders analyzers by `(priority, name)`
  ([mlaify/AttackMap#221](https://github.com/mlaify/AttackMap/issues/221)).

### Fixed

- A repo checked out under a directory named like a skip dir (e.g. `/build/...`,
  `.../out/...`, `.../env/...`) was silently skipped entirely; skip dirs are now
  matched only inside the repo.
- Symlinked files pointing outside the repo are no longer analyzed.
- An unreadable file no longer raises out of `analyze()`, and cp1252/latin-1
  sources are analyzed instead of dropped. `files_scanned` counts only files
  that were actually read.
- `detect()` stops at the first `.py` file and prunes skipped directories
  instead of walking all of them.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-04

### Added

- Initial public release. Comprehensive Python ecosystem analyzer plugin for AttackMap (Django, Starlette, AIOHTTP, Sanic, Litestar, DRF; SQLAlchemy/asyncpg/motor; passlib/PyJWT/authlib; httpx/aiohttp).
- Registered under the `attackmap.analyzers` entry-point group so the core
  AttackMap CLI auto-discovers this analyzer once installed.
- Emits Signal-v2 records (`file:line` citation, evidence text, and confidence
  score) for every signal.
